# Python Basics

## Python Data-types
1. Numeric
   1. Integer --(int value)
   3. Float -- (float value)
   2. Complex Number -- (complex value)
2. Dictionary -- (It is key-value pair set arranged in any order like hash table)
3. Boolean -- (true or false)
4. Set -- (data types unordered collection is Python set)
5. Sequence Type
   1. Strings -- (sequence of characters and string can be defined by single, double or triple quotes).
   2. List --(they are like array but in python different types of data can be added in a single list).
   3. Tuple -- (tuple is also like list, but it uses common parenthesis).

## Exception Handling
   1. try: When there is some kind of error, the program inside the "try" block is verified, but the code in that block is not executed.
   2. except: As previously stated, this operates in conjunction with "try" to handle exception.
   3. finally: Whatever the outcome of the "try" section, the "finally" box is implemented every time.
   4. raise: The raise keyword could be used to specifically raise an exception.
   5. assert: This method is used to help in troubleshooting. Often used to ensure that code is correct. Nothing occurs if an expression is interpreted as true; however, if it is false, "AssertionError" is raised. An output with the error, followed by a comma, can also be printed.

## The pass Keyword

In Python, a null sentence is called a pass. It serves as a stand-in for something else. When it is run, nothing occurs.

## The return keyword
The return expression is used to leave a function and generate a result.
The None keyword is returned by default if we don't specifically return a value.

## THe del keyword
It is used to delete the keyword
